### About me
Hi there! ðŸ’–

My name is Sera (She/They). 
I'm 24 years old, and I'm part Japanese, part Chinese.

I've been studying programming from around when I was 15, and most of what I know today is self-taught. 
I like using my spare time to practice what I've learned, or learn new concepts/ideas in languages I am unfamiliar with. 
I usually apply what I learn by applying them to projects or programs I will actually use - by messing around with things like
Discord bots, small scripts to automate tasks, video game mods, or plugin modules for other programs.

I don't usually upload my ideas or work to GitHub, to be honest - I don't see a use for it! 
I usually apply what I create directly where I need it, so I don't usually upload to preserve my work. 
When I do upload something here, it's mainly because I want to either showcase what I'm working on, or more likely, so I can work on my project on more than one computer.

I am __confident__ with (will be able to work, and understand on projects):
- Python

I am __learning__ (understand most concepts, need help recalling syntax):
- C#
- Kotlin
- Java
- Lua
- Rust
- Javascript/TypeScript

I am __interested__ in learning: 
- Anything! âœ¨

I also have some basic experience messing around with frontend web design, specifically with HTML and CSS. 

Speaking realistically, I don't think there's much that gets in my way of learning new concepts! 
I pick up on ideas very fast, and I can apply it immediately if I can understand what I'm working with.
